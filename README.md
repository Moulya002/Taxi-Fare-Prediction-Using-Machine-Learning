# 🚕 Taxi Fare Prediction using Machine Learning  
### *Predicting taxi fares using trip data, preprocessing, and ML algorithms*

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds a machine learning model to accurately **predict taxi fares** based on trip details such as distance, time, and passenger count. It aims to improve fare transparency for passengers and support efficient pricing strategies in the transportation industry.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Taxi fares fluctuate due to several factors—distance, duration, traffic, and passenger count—leading to unpredictable pricing. The objective is to build a **data-driven model** that estimates fares before a trip begins.

---

## 🧠 Objectives  
- Build a model to predict taxi fares using trip-related features  
- Preprocess and clean real-world taxi trip data  
- Apply ML algorithms to identify key predictors  
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **MAE**  
- Visualize results for insights and interpretability  

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- Trip distance  
- Pick-up and drop-off coordinates  
- Passenger count  
- Trip time and duration  
- Recorded fare amount  

---

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Removing outliers  
- Feature selection  
- Distance and time feature engineering  
- Coordinate-based calculations  

---

## 🤖 Model Implementation  
Models used include:  
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Additional algorithms based on evaluation requirements  

Performance was measured using **RMSE** and **MAE** to determine best fit.

---

## 📈 Results & Analysis  
- Machine Learning effectively predicts fares using core trip features  
- Feature selection significantly improves accuracy  
- Visualizations reveal patterns in distance, time, and fare amounts  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how ML can enhance fare estimation and smart mobility planning. Future enhancements include adding weather, traffic, surge pricing, and real-time GPS data.

---

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Integrate real-time GPS for live fare predictions  
- Build an interactive web/mobile app  
- Test advanced ML models like Gradient Boosting or Deep Learning
